My toy project to make open world action rpg.  
I think it will be a very long-term project because I do it alone!  

## Work In Progress Features
- Asynchorous scene loading
- Procedural contents generation (levels, monsters, items, etc...)
- Navigation system using recast & detour
- Diablo style inventory system
- Diablo style item system
